Python-Encoding

This repository contains basic Python scripts demonstrating different data preprocessing techniques such as -
One Hot Encoding for fitting missing values.
Ordinal Encoding for the same.
Simple Imputation for handling missing data.  

It was created as part of my first AIMS task to explore data preprocessing concepts in machine learning.
